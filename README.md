# BOOKSTORE RAILS HOTWIRE

This application rebuilds the bookstore from the [YoEmber tutorial](https://yoember.com/) using Rails and Hotwire.

The original YoEmber demo application can be found at Live https://library-app.firebaseapp.com

I fast-forwarded a lot of my work by basing the data modelling on an earlier iteration of YoEmber at https://github.com/zoltan-nz/bookstore-api. 

## Install & setup
```bash
bundle install
rails db:setup
```

## Dev
```bash
rails s
```
